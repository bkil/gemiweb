# GemiWeb, the gemini-HTTP/HTML subset

## About

### Inclusive

We were inspired by the gemini protocol, but would like to further extend the gemini community:

* Serve users who lack a gemini browser or TLS
* Serve content creators who do not run a gemini server themselves, but would have access to HTTP-based shared web hosting
  * No-cost shared web hosting is easy to come by

### Open platform

* We would like to counter the pitfalls of WAP whose weakness was being a similar walled garden.

## Goals

* Allow for a full featured client or server to be developed on a weekend.
* Should be compatible with the user base of established software (i.e., web servers & web browsers).
* Collaborate in improving software designed for gemini and gopher.

## Try it

* You should already have access if you are using an up to date version version.

### Clients

### Servers

### Shared hosting services

### Proxies

* No proxy is needed - just use your existing, maintained HTTP based web browser to access content!

## Development

### Libraries

* If you would like to add support in your existing gopher or gemini browser, feel free to use one of our libraries that will convert GemiWeb content to a form of your choice.
* We publish and explain our algorithms if you would like to reimplement it yourself.
  * Happy to help
  * Improvements welcome
