# Community and project management

## Factoring

* anti-bloat: feature creep
* code golfing, minimalism, small is beautiful, less is more
* security: possibility for review, less opportunity for bugs
* NIH: DIY, primitive technology, clean room reimplementation, independence artisan
* transparency: nothing up my sleeves, less opportunity for backdoors
* anti-oligopoly: possibility for competition
* anti vendor lock-in: reproducible environment
* cross-platform: code generation, run anywhere
* self-hosting: migrate between inexpensive alternatives
* retro-computing, cyberpunk: most web pages should function on web browsers from the 1990s or simple present ones which are built and look as if they were from the 1990s

## Out of scope

* making it look pretty
* create a browser according to this specification and expect to be able to view arbitrary old websites from the 1990s

## Common
